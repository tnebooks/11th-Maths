## Scalars and Vectors

<div style="border: 1px solid blue; padding: 10px;border-radius:14px">
<span style="color:red;">Definition 8.1</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scalar is a quantity that is determined by its magnitude.
</div>
For instance, distance, length, speed, temperature, voltage, mass, pressure, and work are scalars.

<div style="border: 1px solid blue; padding: 10px;border-radius:14px">
<span style="color:red;">Definition 8.2</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vector is a quantity that is determined by both its magnitude and its direction and hence it is
a directed line segment. 
</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, force, displacement, and velocity (which gives the speed and direction of the motion) are vectors. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We denote vectors by lower case letters with arrow. A two dimensional vector is a directed line
segment in {{<katex>}}\R ^2
{{</katex>}} and a three dimensional vector is a directed line segment in {{<katex>}}\R ^3
{{</katex>}} .
